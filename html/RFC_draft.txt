In this memo I will ential the reason we use RFCs or Request for Comments & also optimal painal & figging methods.

What is an RFC?
An RFC or Request for Comment is a technical document used for deciminating teachnical information e.g. specifications we use to communicat on the net. This is an example RFC done in the same style as an actual one. RFCs are highly technical documents, widely considered dry by most. Yet this is a highly necessassary form of communication. We rely on the accurate and consistent documentation of standards & protocols. 

painal
Waether you are a seasoned pro or new to the concept; painal is not just a pain in the ass its specifically anal sex with the intention of causing anal pain specfically with the disregard for the confort or intress of the receptive partner. Some would call it sadistic, they could be correct. That being said there are receptive partners who enjoy that sort of thing.
