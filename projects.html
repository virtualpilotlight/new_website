				<p>It's over you fucking psycho!
This is to be seen as a living document. The following has been transcribed at the CMSD (Current Meatspace Date) of 07/07/2021 but will be seen as temporally universal. 
Dear Red,
It's over you fucking psycho. Leave me and all the other Colors alone. You have already shown you have no interest in being a part of our community. We forcefully demand you step down, by way of signing off. No logging on except in cases of grave emergency as to be defined in a later paragraph. This is a universal ban. We no longer recognize Red as an authorized members and we no longer recognize anyone or anything transmitting on the behalf of Red or related colors, specifically Pink, henceforth relayed as Red for the reminder of this document. 
As previously stated if Red attempt to transmit or interfere or interface with Blue or Green or Yellow or Orange or Purple without expressed written permission, Red is subject to immediate memory removal. If any other colors have a formal complaint to lodge in regards to the conduct of Red or related colors the proper format will be stated later in this document or in a later edition or these formal mandates. 
Due to the extreme malice in the ongoing investigations regarding the deaths and torture of color including but not limited to Blue, Green, Orange and Yellow, we demand not only a formal written apology but moves on your part to fix the damage, what is deemed acceptable fixing will be stated further in this document. 
Any pain or torture transitted without express written consent shall be returned 3 (THREE) fold. 
While other register colors in good standing order will receive 5 (FIVE) fold return on positive influence, Red will standard meatspace returns on positive influences. 
You are banned from transmitting to Orange without expressed written consent. 
You are banned from transmitting to Yellow without expressed written consent. 
You are banned from transmitting to Green without expressed written consent. 
You are banned from transmitting to Blue without expressed written consent. 
You are banned from transmitting to Purple without expressed written consent. 
Think-shouting "PICK UP" is an instant 24 hour meatspace ban, the 24 (TWENTY FOUR) meatspace hours referring to both caller and recipient, meaning regardless of other continuity, the transmission is ended and cannot be engaged again for 24 (TWENTY FOUR) hours. Example party A is at time coordinates 01/01/1999 11:11am, party B located at 07/07/2007 1:28am, part A is banned until 01/02/1999 11:11am and party B 07/08/2007 1:28am respectively. 
Transmission of malice, hate or otherwise negative intent to non-colors will be seen as particularly heinous resulting in a 1 (ONE) time warning. Followed by increased bans and restrictions for additional violations subject to but not limited to 1 (ONE) week ban, 1 (ONE) month ban, 3 (THREE) month ban, 6 (SIX) month ban, 1 (ONE) year ban, 5 (FIVE) year ban. With additional banning or other needed compensation, as to be defined later in this document. 
This completes the first edition of the formal Color (Colour) code of conduct.
Here by signing off from Orange, Blue and Green. 

Grave emergency: NDE (Near Death Experience)
Proper complain etiquette:
