## NOTES

Issues implimenting fan_site page, CSS conflicts unable to use background or the backgroud-image property multiple time. I think it is applied to the body element when it needs to be seperate for the header. I made an under construction page, since home page now has the unstyled PHP guest book. I think I removed the template page, though it would be a good to have an example page that shows the different custtome CSS that I have made so far.  I think I need to do some commenting and like refomatting. 
home.html is good, resume.html needs some style adjustment, projects.html created.
